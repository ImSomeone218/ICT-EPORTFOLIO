I don't have a lot of hobbies, but I have one main thing I like to do in my free time<br>
and that's playing my guitar. I'm acutally a part of a band as the Rhythm/Lead Guitarist,<br>
and I'm very proud to say that. In last year's Battle of The Bnads at School, we received<br>
individual awards and we also won as the Champion! It's still quite shocking to me to think<br>
we palced 3rd in the BoTB in 2023, and now, we placed as the champion, and I am forver<br>
greatful for that opportunity that was given to us.
